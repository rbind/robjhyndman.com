The first [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/) unconference in Australia will be held on Thursday and Friday (April 21-22) in Brisbane, at the Microsoft Innovation Centre.

This event will bring together researchers, developers, data scientists and open data enthusiasts from industry, government and university. The aim is to conceptualise and develop R-based tools that address current challenges in data science, open science and reproducibility.
