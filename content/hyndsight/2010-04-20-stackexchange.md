Regular readers of this site will know I'm a fan of using [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for questions about LaTeX, R and other areas of programming. Now the people who produce Stack Overflow are planning on setting up several new sites for asking questions about other topics, and are seeking proposals. I have [proposed that there should be a site for questions on data analysis, statistics, data mining, machine learning, etc. ](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5547)

It is more likely that my idea will turn into a functioning site if people who agree with me vote for it. So if you agree, please head over to [meta.stackexchange.com](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5547) and vote! (You will need to register first, but that's free.)

If you disagree or have any comments about the idea, I'd also like to hear from you. But please add your comments to my proposal rather than here.
