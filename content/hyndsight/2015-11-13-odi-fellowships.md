The [Overseas Development Institute Fellowship Scheme](http://www.odi.org/fellowship-scheme) sends young postgraduate statisticians (and economists) to work in the public sectors of developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific on two-year contracts. This is a great way to develop skills and gain experience working within a developing country's government. And you get to live in a fascinating place!

The application process for the 2016-2018 Fellowship Scheme is now open. Students are advised to apply before 17 December 2015 for a chance to be part of the ODI Fellowship Scheme.

Essential criteria:




    
  * degree in statistics, economics, or a related field

    
  * postgraduate degree qualification

    
  * ability to commit to a two-year assignment



Application is via the [online application form](https://jobs.odi.org.uk/VacancyInformation.aspx?VId=24469).
