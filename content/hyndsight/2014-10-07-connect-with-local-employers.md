I keep telling students that there are lots of jobs in data science (including statistics), and they often tell me they can't find them advertised. As usual, you do have to do some networking, and one of the best ways of doing it is via a Data Science Meetup. Many cities now have them including [Melbourne](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Melbourne/), [Sydney](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Sydney/), [London](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-London), etc. It is the perfect opportunity to meet with local employers, many of which are hiring due to the huge expansion in the use of data analysis in business (aka business analytics).

At the end of each Melbourne meetup, some employers have been advertising their current analytic job openings to the audience.

Now the local organizers are going to extend the opportunity to allow job-searchers to give a 90 second pitch to employers. [Details are provided on the message board](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Melbourne/messages/boards/thread/47671902).
