This is an interesting development! How many papers are published by bogus authors, and what is the going price for a coauthorship? Needless to say, this is appalling and contrary to every academic integrity policy I've seen. See the [Monash authorship policy](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/authorship/) for example.

> Dear Hyndman, Rob J.<br><br>
> Hope you are doing well.<br><br>
> I write this letter on behalf of authors seeking to co-publish. We have seen your previous works (https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7006914313&eid=2-s2.0-85063573156
) and they were considered to be of high quality. Therefore, I offer you a co-publishing partnership.<br><br>
> Our clients wish to buy positions in scientific articles that are in line with their research interests. As our partner, you can offer us a position or two in your work. 
> In this way, we develop a network of scientists with whom we would like to partner.
> We hope you will agree that this type of partnership can be mutually beneficial, and beneficial for authors too!<br><br>
> If you are interested in this, please, let me know. I will forward all required information to you and answer all your questions.<br><br>
> P.S. Sorry for bothering you if you find this letter useless and not interesting.<br><br>
> Respectfully,<br>
> Dr. Stutaluk Vladimir
