The [FPP resources page](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/resources) has recently been updated with several new additions including




    
  * R code for all examples in the book. This was already available within each chapter, but the examples have been collected into one file per chapter to save copying and pasting the various code fragments.

    
  * Slides from a course on Predictive Analytics from the University of Sydney.

    
  * Slides from a course on Economic Forecasting from the University of Hawaii.



If any one using the book has other material that could be made available, please [send them to me](mailto:Rob.Hyndman@monash.edu?Subject=Material%20for FPP). For example, recorded lectures, slides, additional examples, assignments, exam questions, solutions, etc.
