Review papers are extremely useful for new researchers such as PhD students, or when you want to learn about a new research field. The _International Journal of Forecasting_ produced a whole [review issue in 2006](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/01692070/22/3), and it contains some of the most highly cited papers we have ever published. Now, beginning with the latest issue of the journal, we have started publishing occasional review articles on selected areas of forecasting. The first two articles are:




    
  1. [Electricity price forecasting: A review of the state-of-the-art with a look into the future](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207014001083) by Rafał Weron.

    
  2. [The challenges of pre-launch forecasting of adoption time series for new durable products](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207014001095) by Paul Goodwin, Sheik Meeran, and Karima Dyussekeneva.



Both tackle very important topics in forecasting. Weron's paper contains a comprehensive survey of work on electricity price forecasting, coherently bringing together a large body of diverse research --- I think it is the longest paper I have ever approved at 50 pages. Goodwin, Meeran and Dyussekeneva review research on new product forecasting, a problem every company that produces goods or services has faced; when there are no historical data available, how do you forecast the sales of your product?

We have a few other review papers in progress, so keep an eye out for them in future issues.
