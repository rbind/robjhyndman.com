In just over three weeks, the [inaugural MeDaScIn event](http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/medascin2016/) will take place. This is an initiative to grow the talent pool of local data scientists and to promote Melbourne as a world city of excellence in Data Science.

The main event takes place on Friday 6th May, with lots of interesting sounding titles and speakers from business and government. I'm the only academic speaker on the program, giving the closing talk on "Automatic FoRecasting". Earlier in the day I am running a forecasting workshop where I will discuss forecasting issues and answer questions for about 90 minutes. There are still a few places left for the main event, and for the workshops. Book soon if you want to attend.
