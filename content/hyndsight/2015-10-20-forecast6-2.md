It is a while since I last updated the [CRAN version of the forecast package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=forecast), so I uploaded the latest version (6.2) today. The [github version](https://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast) remains the most up-to-date version and is already two commits ahead of the CRAN version.

This update is mostly bug fixes and additional error traps. The full ChangeLog is listed below.<!-- more -->




    
  * Many unit tests added using `testthat`.

    
  * Fixed bug in `ets()` when very short seasonal series were passed in a data frame.

    
  * Fixed bug in `nnetar()` where the initial predictor vector was reversed.

    
  * Corrected model name returned in `nnetar()`.

    
  * Fixed bug in `accuracy()` when non-integer seasonality used.

    
  * Made `auto.arima()` robust to non-integer seasonality.

    
  * Fixed bug in `auto.arima()` where `allowmean` was ignored when `stepwise=FALSE`.

    
  * Improved robustness of `forecast.ets()` for explosive models with multiplicative trends.

    
  * Exogenous variables now passed to VAR forecasts

    
  * Increased maximum `nmse` in `ets()` to 30.

    
  * Made `tsoutliers()` more robust to weak seasonality

    
  * Changed `tsoutliers()` to use `supsmu` on non-seasonal and seasonally adjusted data.

    
  * Fixed bug in `tbats()` when seasonal period 1 is a small multiple of seasonal period 2.

    
  * Other bug fixes
