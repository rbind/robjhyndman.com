This is not a help service for all your R and forecasting questions, so please don't post questions in the comments, or send them to me by email.

If you have questions about data analysis, ask for help on [crossvalidated.com](http://crossvalidated.com).

If you have questions about R, ask for help on [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com).

If you think you have found a bug in one of my R packages, report it on github as explained [here](/hyndsight/minimal-reproducible-examples/).
