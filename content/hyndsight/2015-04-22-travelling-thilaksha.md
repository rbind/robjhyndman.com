One of my PhD students, Thilaksha Tharanganie, has been very successful in getting travel funding to attend conferences. She was the subject of a write-up in today's [Monash News](https://www.monash.edu/news/show/phd-student-scoops-international-travel-awards).

We encourage students to attend conferences, and provide funding for them to attend one international conference and one local conference during their PhD candidature. Thilaksha was previously funded to attend last year's [COMPSTAT in Geneva, Switzerland](http://compstat2014.org/) and [IMS conference in Sydney](http://ims-asc2014.com/). Having exhausted local funding, she has now convinced several other organizations to support her conference habit.

Now she just has to finish that thesis...
