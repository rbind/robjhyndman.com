I have [argued previously](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/working-papers/) that research papers should be posted online at the same time as they are submitted to a journal. Sometimes people claim that journals don't allow it, which is nonsense. Almost every journal allows it, and many also allow the published version of a paper to appear on your personal website.

Today I discovered a new tool (thanks to the [IMU newsletter](http://www.mathunion.org/imu-net/archive/2012/imu-net-054/)) which makes it easy to check a journal's policy on this. Check out [**SHERPA/RoMEO**](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/). 

It's a very useful tool, but whoever thought SHERPA/RoMEO was a good name needs therapy.
