This week, I am teaching my Business Analytics class about the bias-variance trade-off. For some reason, the proof is not contained in either [ESL](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) or [ISL](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), even though it is quite simple. I also discovered that the [proof currently provided on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff#Derivation) makes little sense in places.

So I wrote my own for the class. It is longer than necessary to ensure there are no jumps that might confuse students.
