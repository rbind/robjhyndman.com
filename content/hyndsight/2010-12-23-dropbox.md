Every couple of years, a new technology has a big impact on how I work. Gmail was one. My iPhone was another. And I rank [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI5MDc4MjE5?src=global0) in the same category.

I get three huge benefits in using [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI5MDc4MjE5?src=global0):



	
  1. **_All_ my files are backed up online**. The house can burn down and I know I can still get my files. Also, if I'm away from my desktop or laptop, I can still access my files [on my iPhone](http://www.dropbox.com/iphoneapp). Online backup is the only sensible backup strategy.

	
  2. **My two main computers are kept in sync**. When I finish work in my uni office, I can go home knowing that everything I've done during the day will be already on my home PC when I arrive home. And when I go to my uni office, everything I've done on my home PC will already be on my uni PC when I get to work. I never have to think about what files I will need; they will all be there.

	
  3. **[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI5MDc4MjE5?src=global0) provides a simple version control system**. Other people use services like [github](https://github.com/) and [bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/), but I find them far more complicated than I need. When I edit or delete files, [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI5MDc4MjE5?src=global0) keeps previous versions in case I wish to restore them (up to 30 days normally, but forever if you pay a bit more). With a couple of clicks I can rollback to a previous version, or download a previous version and use a file comparison tool to see the changes made since that version.


The best thing is that I get those benefits without any work! Once installed, [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI5MDc4MjE5?src=global0) just does its stuff seamlessly in the background.

For up to 2Gb, it is free. I pay $99 per year for 50Gb. If you [sign up](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI5MDc4MjE5?src=global0) as a result of this post, you get an additional 250Mb free (and I get another 500Mb -- although I'd say all of the above regardless). Available for Windows, Mac or Linux.
