One of the great services of the Statistical Society of Australia is [an excellent **jobs board**](http://careers.statsoc.org.au) advertising available jobs for statisticians, data analysts, data scientists, etc. Jobs can be filtered by industry, location and job function.

Today the SSA announced a new service to job seekers: CV/Resume Critique.<!-- more -->


>As a job seeker, registered on the SSA Job Board, you now have the option to request a free, confidential CV/resume evaluation from an expert and writer.

>You can participate in this feature when uploading a CV/resume to our Society’s Job Board through the CV/Resume Management section of your job seeker account. Within 48 hours of opt-in, an email will be sent to you outlining your strengths, weaknesses and suggestions to ensure you have the best chance of getting interviewed!

>Your ”Job Search Resource Centre” on the SSA website has everything you need to make your resume stand out, ace the interview, advance your statistical career and navigate the digital world through social media and digital communication.
