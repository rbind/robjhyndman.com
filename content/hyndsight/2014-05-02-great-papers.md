My research group meets every two weeks. It is always fun to talk about general research issues and new tools and tips we have discovered. We also use some of the time to discuss a paper that I choose for them. Today we discussed [Breiman's classic (2001) two cultures paper](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726) --- something every statistician should read, including the discussion.

I select papers that I want every member of research team to be familiar with. Usually they are classics in forecasting, or they are recent survey papers.

In the last couple of months we have also read the following papers:





  * [Timmermann (2008) Elusive return predictability](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijforecast.2007.07.008)


  * [Diebold (2013) Comparing predictive accuracy, twenty years later: A personal perspective on the use and abuse of Diebold-Mariano tests](http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/papers/paper113/Diebold_DM%20Test.pdf)


  * [Gneiting and Katsfuss (2014) Probabilistic forecasting](http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-062713-085831)


  * [Makridakis and Hibon (1978) Accuracy of forecasting: an empirical investigation](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345077)
