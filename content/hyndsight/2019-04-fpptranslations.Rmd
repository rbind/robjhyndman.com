There are now translations of my forecasting textbook (coauthored with George Athanasopoulos) into Chinese and Korean.

The [**Chinese translation**](https://otexts.com/fppcn/) was produced by a team led by [Professor Yanfei Kang](https://yanfei.site/) (Beihang University) and [Professor Feng Li](https://feng.li/) (Central University of Finance and Economics). The following students were also involved: Cheng Fan, Liu Yu, Long Xiaoyu, Wang Xiaoqian, Zeng Jiayue, Zhang Bohan, and Zhu Shuaidong.

The [**Korean translation**](https://otexts.com/fppkr/) was produced by [Dr Daniel Young Ho Kim](http://danielykim.me/).

I am very thankful to the hard work and language skills of these people, making the book more accessible to many more people.

If anyone else is interested in creating an online translation of the book into their own language, please let me know.
