It's not every day that seasonal adjustment makes the front page of the newspapers, but it has today with the [ABS saying that the recent seasonally adjusted unemployment data would be revised](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-08/abs-abandons-seasonal-adjustment-for-latest-jobs-data/5798650).

I was interviewed about the underlying concepts for the _Guardian_ in [this piece](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/oct/09/abs-jobs-and-unemployment-figures-key-questions-answered-by-an-expert).

Further comment from me about [users paying for the ABS data is here](http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/09/paying-for-abs-data-experts-warn-hockey-idea-extremely-detrimental).
