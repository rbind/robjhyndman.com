Robert Goodell Brown was the father of exponential smoothing. He died last week at the age of 90. While I never met him, I was indebted to him for exponential smoothing and his practical and insightful [books](http://www.amazon.com/Smoothing-Forecasting-Prediction-Discrete-Editions/dp/0486495922/?tag=prorobjhyn-20).

Today I received this email from King Harrison III advising of his death.<!-- more -->

>Twenty years ago I attended the ISF 93 conference in Pittsburgh, which honored Bob Brown on his 70th birthday, and his contributions to the forecasting world.

>My reason to attend ISF 93? To meet the man who had developed Exponential Smoothing, which I had been using in inventory replenishment systems for years.

>That began a 20 year relationship with Bob, first in a business context, and then the past 8 years as a friend.

>He passed last week, at home.

>I attended the memorial service for Bob this past Sunday, at his home in Vermont.

>This morning his son Todd Brown sent Bob's obit, at the link below.

>For the past 2 decades Bob has been my mentor on both business and life challenges. I will miss him.

>At my last annual visit to see Bob, this past June, he asked if I was interested in his working papers and research material for his career.

>The first 200 lbs of that information arrived a month ago, and is in my office.

>His son Todd is working with me to obtain the remaining information.

>I have contacted Georgia Tech as a landing place for all of Bob's work.

>If you have questions, certainly contact me at the information below.

>Best regards,
>King III ([king3@k3s.com](mailto:king3@k3s.com))
