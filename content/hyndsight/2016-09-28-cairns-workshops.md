![Cairns Esplanade](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Cairns_Landscape.jpg)The 37th annual [**International Symposium on Forecasting**](http://forecasters.org/isf) will be held in Cairns, Australia, from 25-28 June 2017. We plan to hold some workshops on Sunday 25 June, before the main conference.<!-- more -->

We are currently calling for workshop proposals. Proposals can be for a half-day or full-day workshop. As usual, there will be a Practitioner Track at the conference which generally leads to excellent attendance at the workshops.

Though June sounds far away, planning for the conference is well underway! If you are interested in proposing a workshop, please provide the following information by 3 November 2017:




    
  * Title of workshop

    
  * Duration – 1/2 or full day

    
  * A brief synopsis (about 1/2 page).

    
  * Any additional details pertaining to your workshop, which will assist us in the review process.



Proposals should be sent by email to [pamstroud@forecasters.org](mailto:pamstroud@forecasters.org).

All proposals will be assessed by the organizing committee, and we will let you know the outcome by the end of November.

Our [workshop guidelines](/files/ISF_Workshop-Guidelines_2016.pdf) provide details on leading a workshop. If you need any clarification, please feel free to contact Pam at the above email address.
