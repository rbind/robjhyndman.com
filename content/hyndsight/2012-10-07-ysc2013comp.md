The Australian Young Statisticians Conference (Feb 2013) is organizing a communication competition. They invite all early-career statisticians (studying, or within 5 years of graduation) to produce a short (3-5 minute) video for the ABS YSC2013 Video Competition, or a static infographic for the ABS YSC2013 Infographic Competition.

Both competitions have a 1st prize of $500, and 2nd prize of $250.

Entries close 16th November, and winners will be notified by mid-December.

Details available at: ysc2013.com/program/competitions/

I'm a speaker at the conference, so hopefully I will get to see some of the great entries!
