We have another position available, this time for a lecturer (equivalent to an assistant professor tenure track in the US). The department covers a wide range of areas in statistics and econometrics, but for this position we are looking for someone with expertise in at least one of business analytics, data science, actuarial science, computational statistics and machine learning. Applicants who have recently completed a PhD, or expect to do so in the next 6 months, are welcome to apply.

The position is advertised on the [Amstat jobs site](http://jobs.amstat.org/jobs/8524965/lecturer-level-b-equivalent-to-assistant-professor-tenure-track) and on the [Monash careers site](http://careersmanager.pageuppeople.com/513/cw/en/job/553982/lecturer-econometrics-and-business-statistics).

Enquiries to [Professor Heather Anderson](http://www.monash.edu.au/research/people/profiles/profile.html?sid=35634&pid=5205&sa=U).
