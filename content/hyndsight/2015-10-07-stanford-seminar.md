I gave a seminar at Stanford today. Slides are below. It was definitely the most intimidating audience I've faced, with Jerome Friedman, Trevor Hastie, Brad Efron, Persi Diaconis, Susan Holmes, David Donoho and John Chambers all present (and probably other famous names I've missed).

I'll be giving essentially the same talk at [UC Davis on Thursday](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/seminars/library/2015-16/fall15/100815-hyndman.html).<!-- more -->
