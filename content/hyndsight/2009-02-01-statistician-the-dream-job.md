So what is the ultimate job? According to Hal Varian, chief economist at Google, it is being a statistician (see [this interview](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/25/hal-varian-answers-your-questions/#more-2345))

**Statistics - Dream Job of the next decade**



From a keynote presentation to the 2008 Almaden Institute -  "Innovating with Information".

The full presentation is available at [http://www.almaden.ibm.com/institute/agenda.shtml](http://www.almaden.ibm.com/institute/agenda.shtml)

Hal Varian makes the argument that with data in huge supply and statisticians in short supply, being a statistician has to be the 'really sexy job for the 2010s'.
