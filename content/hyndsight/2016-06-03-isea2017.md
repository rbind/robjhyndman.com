This will be a great conference, and it is in a great location --- Cairns, Australia, right by the Great Barrier Reef. Even better, if you stay on you can attend the **International Symposium on Forecasting** which immediately follows the **International Symposium on Energy Analytics**.

So block out 22-28 June 2017 on your calendars so you can enjoy a tropical paradise in one of the most beautiful parts of Australia, while attending two awesome conferences.

This symposium aims at bringing forecasting experts and practitioners together to share experiences and best practices on a wide range of important business problems in the energy industry. Here the energy industry broadly covers utilities, oil, gas and mining industries. The subjects to be forecasted range from supply, demand and price, to asset/system condition and customer count. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:




    
  * Probabilistic energy forecasting

    
  * Hierarchical energy forecasting

    
  * High-dimensional energy forecasting

    
  * High-frequency and high-resolution energy forecasting

    
  * Equipment failure prediction

    
  * Power systems fault prediction

    
  * Automatic outlier detection

    
  * Load profiling

    
  * Customer segmentation

    
  * Customer churn prediction



Selected papers will be published in a special section of the _International Journal of Forecasting_.
