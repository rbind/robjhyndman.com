The "Monash Academy for Cross and Interdisciplinary Mathematical Applications" (MAXIMA) is a new research centre that aims to maximise the potential of mathematics to deliver impact to society. It will be led by [Kate Smith-Miles](http://users.monash.edu.au/~ksmiles/). I will also be involved along with several other mathematicians at Monash. Our mission at MAXIMA is to find solutions to 21st century problems by dismantling mathematical barriers. 

MAXIMA will be launched on 25 September at a public lecture on "The Role of Embedded Optimization in Smart Systems and Products".
