Staying in touch with other researchers is important. You need to know about up-coming conferences, seminars, jobs, etc. To this end, it is worth finding a few key email lists to join. A long list of lists in econometrics and statistics is provided by [EconometricLinks](http://www.feweb.vu.nl/econometriclinks/mailing/#top). Browse through it to find topics of interest. No doubt researchers in other disciplines have their own lists, but I don't know about them.

For those in Australia and New Zealand, there are two local lists that every statistician and econometrician should be on:



	
  * Australia and New Zealand statistics: [ANZstat](http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/research/research_centres/anzstat/).

	
  * Australia and New Zealand econometrics: [ANZecmet](http://groups.google.com/group/anzecmet/about)
