A few weeks ago I had a Skype chat with [Tim Harford](http://timharford.com/), the "Undercover Economist" for Britain's _[Financial Times](http://www.ft.com)_. He was working on an article for the FT on forecasting, and wanted my perspective as an academic forecaster. I mostly talked about what makes some things more predictable than others, as discussed in [this blog post](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/hardforecasts/). In the end, [his article](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3950604a-33bc-11e4-ba62-00144feabdc0.html) headed in a different direction, so I don't get quoted, but it is still [a good read](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3950604a-33bc-11e4-ba62-00144feabdc0.html)!

He also put out this YouTube summary, for those who don't like to read:
