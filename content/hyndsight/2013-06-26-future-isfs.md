The next few locations for the [International Symposium on Forecasting](http://www.forecasters.org/isf) [have been announced](http://forecasters.org/conferences/international-symposium-on-forecasting/):



	
  * 2014: Rotterdam, The Netherlands

	
  * 2015: Riverside, California, USA

	
  * 2016: Santander, Spain

	
  * 2017: Cairns, Australia


The ISF is easily the best forecasting conference, and is held every year in different locations. The 2013 conference finished today in Seoul, South Korea.

I'm especially delighted that it is coming back to Australia in 2017. It has only once before been held in Australia, in 2004. I was program co-chair for the 2004 conference, and I will be general chair of the 2017 conference. It's too early to pack your bags for Cairns, but [check out the great location](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=cairns+images&qscrl=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=jpTKUfrDAqSyiQfdkIHADA&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&biw=1301&bih=656). The venue will be the [Cairns Convention Centre](http://www.cairnsconvention.com.au/).
