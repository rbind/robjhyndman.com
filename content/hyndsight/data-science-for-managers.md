For the last few years, I have been involved with running a 3-day short course on ["Data Science for Managers"](https://www.monash.edu/it/data-science). We have run it twice each year since 2015, and it continues to prove very popular. We have some awesome presenters including Monash University professors [Di Cook](http://dicook.org/), [Geoff Webb](http://i.giwebb.com/), and [Kim Marriott](http://users.monash.edu/~marriott/shadowfax/), as well as [several very experienced data scientists working in industry](https://www.monash.edu/it/data-science/speakers).

The next course will be held on **8-10 May 2018**. All the details are on the [website](https://www.monash.edu/it/data-science). [Book early to avoid missing out](https://www.monash.edu/it/data-science/tickets).
