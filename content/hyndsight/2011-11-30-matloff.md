excerpt: This is a gem of a book. It will become the book I give PhD students when
  they are learning how to write good R code. That is, if I ever see it again. I had
  hoped to write a review of it, but I haven't seen it since it arrived in the mail
  a couple of weeks ago because a research student or research assistant has always
  had it on loan. I guess that's a testament to how useful it is.

This is a gem of a book. It will become the book I give PhD students when they are learning how to write good R code. That is, if I ever see it again. I had hoped to write a review of it, but I haven't seen it since it arrived in the mail a couple of weeks ago because a research student or research assistant has always had it on loan. I guess that's a testament to how useful it is.<!-- more -->

Other people have reviewed the book including [Joseph Rickert](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2011/11/review-of-the-art-of-r-programming-by-norman-matloff.html) and [Nathan Yau](http://flowingdata.com/2011/11/16/book-the-art-of-r-programming/), as well as a few people on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/review/1593273843?ie=UTF8&ref_=cm_cr_dp_all_summary&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending&_encoding=UTF8&tag=prorobjhyn-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957) (with ten 5-star reviews to date!).

At less then $25, you have little to lose -- [head over to Amazon and buy a copy now](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593273843/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=prorobjhyn-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1593273843)! If a few of my PhD students buy their own copies, I might get mine back.
