[Jane Frazier](https://twitter.com/mignon1915) spoke at our research team meeting today on "Reproducibility in computational research". We had a very stimulating and lively discussion about the issues involved. One interesting idea was that reproducibility is on a scale, and we can all aim to move further along the scale towards making our own research more reproducible. For example


 * Can you reproduce your results tomorrow on the same computer with the same software installed?
 * Could someone else on a different computer reproduce your results with the same software installed?
 * Could you reproduce your results in 3 years time after some of your software environment may have changed?
 * etc.


Think about what changes you need to make to move one step further along the reproducibility continuum, and do it.
