A couple of weeks ago, Google scholar added a facility to provide email alerts on new articles associated with specific search queries. First do the search, then click the envelope at top left of screen. For example, here is a search on "exponential smoothing" since 2000.

Note the envelope at the top marked New! Click it to get the following screen.

Those results show some of the flaws in Google Scholar -- the dates are not always correct (the first paper listed above appeared in 2004) and there are unresolved duplicates.

Despite the problems, if you're wanting to keep an eye out for new papers on particular topics, this looks like it could be useful. Unfortunately, there is no RSS feed available.
