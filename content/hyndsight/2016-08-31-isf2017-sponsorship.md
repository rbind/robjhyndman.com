Regular readers will know that the [International Symposium on Forecasting](http://forecasters.org/isf) is coming to Australia in June 2017. This is the leading international forecasting conference, and one I've attended every year for the past 17 years.

It will be held in Cairns, Australia --- one of the most beautiful locations in the country (and there is some stiff competition!) and right next to the Great Barrier Reef. Some further information is available [on our website](https://forecasters.org/isf/) (still in progress).

This is only the second time it has been held in Australia, with the 2004 conference being held in Sydney. We expect to get about 300 people attending, 2/3 from academia and 1/3 from business, industry and government.

Right now, I'm looking for organizations who wish to get involved with some sponsorship. Sponsor information is highly visible at the conference, as well as on the website, the program and other publications, so it is an opportunity to support the forecasting community, promote your organization, and perhaps recruit some young rising stars in the analytics world.<!-- more -->

Further details are available in our [sponsorship brochure](https://forecasters.org/wp-content/uploads/ISF-2017_SponsorBrochure.pdf).

Please [email me](mailto:Rob.Hyndman@monash.edu) if you wish to discuss becoming a sponsor.
