For all those people asking me how to obtain a print version of my book "Forecasting: principles and practice" with George Athanasopoulos, you now can.

[![FPP cover](/files/fppcover.jpg)](https://www.createspace.com/4486639)

**[Order on Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0987507109/&tag=otexts-20)**

**[Order on Amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0987507109/?tag=otexts-21)**

**[Order on Amazon.fr](http://www.amazon.fr/dp/0987507109/)**

The online book will continue to be freely available. The print version of the book is intended to help fund the development of the [OTexts platform](http://www.otexts.org).

The price is US$45, £27 or €35. 

Compare that to $195 for [my previous forecasting textbook](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471532339?tag=otexts-20),  $150 for [Fildes and Ord](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0324311273/?tag=otexts-20), or $182 for [Gonzalez-Rivera](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0131474936/&tag=otexts-20). No matter how good the books are, the prices are absurdly high. 

[OTexts](http://www.otexts.org) is intended to be a different kind of publisher --- all our books are online and free, those in print will be reasonably priced.

The online version will continue to be updated regularly. The print version is a snapshot of the online version today. We will release a new print edition occasionally, no more than annually and only when the online version has changed enough to warrant a new print edition.

We are planning an offline electronic version as well. I'll announce it here when it is ready.
