[Richard Hamming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) was an excellent mathematician who worked at the interface of mathematics and computer science. In 1986 he gave a wonderful talk entitled [_You and Your Research_](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html). Derek Smith on the [AMS Graduate Student blog](http://mathgradblog.williams.edu/?p=1224) reminded me of it today. If you haven't read it previously, stop work immediately and [**read it now**](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html).
