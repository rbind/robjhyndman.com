The StackExchange site on Statistical Analysis is about to go into private beta testing. This is your [last chance to commit](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/33/statistical-analysis?referrer=E0CJiqTtta01) if you want to be part of the private beta testing. Don't worry if you miss out --- it will only be a week before it is then open to the public.

There is also a [StackExchange site proposal for TeX, LaTeX and friends](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/2148/tex-latex-and-friends?referrer=qoV-cGY7riE1). Presumably that means that most of the [LaTeX questions on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/latex) will then move to this new site. It still needs a couple of hundred more people to commit before it can be launched, so if you are interested in LaTeX, [please commit](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/2148/tex-latex-and-friends?referrer=qoV-cGY7riE1) to being part of it.

Another site proposal that may be of interest to readers of this blog is the one on [English language usage](http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/1269/english-language-usage?referrer=DlbQepU85BI1).

A few proposals are already open to the public for beta testing. One that I've been using a little is [Web Apps](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/) which is useful for questions on Gmail, Google reader, Wordpress, etc.
