If you are reading this in Google Reader, or you are reading in an RSS reader that uses Google Reader as a back-end, then you probably need this reminder. Everyone else can stop reading now.<!-- more -->

Google Reader will cease to be available on 1 July and you will lose all your feeds and other data if you have not switched before then.

I have switched to using [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com) and it is a very convenient replacement. Just go to feedly, import your Google Reader feeds, and you're done. But you need to do it before 1 July or you will lose all your Google Reader feeds. Other possible replacements are [discussed here](http://lifehacker.com/5990881/five-best-google-reader-alternatives).
