The latest minor release of the forecast package has now been approved on CRAN and should be available in the next day or so.

Version 8.5 contains the following new features

  * Updated `tsCV()` to handle exogenous regressors.
  * Reimplemented `naive()`, `snaive()`, `rwf()` for substantial speed improvements.
  * Added support for passing arguments to `auto.arima()` unit root tests.
  * Improved `auto.arima()` stepwise search algorithm (some neighbouring models were missed previously).

We haven't done a major release for two years, and there is unlikely to be another one now. Instead, we are working hard on [fable](https://github.com/tidyverts/fable), a tidyverse replacement for the forecast package.

The forecast package will continue to be maintained, but no new features will be added.
