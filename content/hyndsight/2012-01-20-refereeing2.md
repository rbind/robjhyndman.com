  1. [Refereeing a journal article part 1: reading](http://patthomson.wordpress.com/2012/01/07/refereeing-a-journal-article-part-1-reading/)

	
  2. [Refereeing a journal article part 2: making a recommendation](http://patthomson.wordpress.com/2012/01/13/refereeing-a-journal-article-part-2-making-a-recommendation/)
