If you love statistics (don't we all?) and can write Chinese (which rules me out), you might like to contribute to the [Chinese National Bureau of Statistics celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the "founding of New China"](https://web.archive.org/web/20131001043955/http://www.stats.gov.cn/stwy/wmyqzg/). They are calling for submissions of prose, poetry or song which will "enhance people's patriotic feelings, statistics and confidence". Here is an [English translation of the page](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20131001043955%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.stats.gov.cn%2Fstwy%2Fwmyqzg%2F&sandbox=1).

Some further translations are on the [WSJ page](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinajournal/2009/07/31/songs-of-statistics-odes-to-the-motherland-from-an-unlikely-source/).

I especially like this section from "Love the Homeland, Love Statistics":


>Because of statistics<br>
I can solve the deepest mysteries<br>
Because of statistics<br>
I will not be lonely again, playing in the data<br>
Because of statistics<br>
I can rearrange the stars in the skies above<br>
Because of statistics<br>
My life is different, more meaningful<br>
I love my life, my statistics


Ah. We're an emotional lot really.
