I'm currently attending the [one day workshop on this topic](https://web.archive.org/web/20170305013150/http://acems.org.au/statistical-modelling-and-analysis-of-big-data-workshop-2015//) at QUT in Brisbane. This morning I spoke on "Visualizing and forecasting big time series data". My [slides are here](/seminars/big-time-series-data/).



### OVERVIEW



Big data is now endemic in business, industry, government, environmental management, medical science, social research and so on. One of the commensurate challenges is how to effectively model and analyse these data.

This workshop will bring together national and international experts in statistical modelling and analysis of big data, to share their experiences, approaches and opinions about future directions in this field.
