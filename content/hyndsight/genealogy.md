Having a PhD student is like having a child. I have had many such "children" graduate, and have another few "on the way". (See [here](/research-team) for my offspring.)

Going in the other direction, here is my family tree (or one branch of it), compiled from the [Mathematical Genealogy Project](http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/). Each successive person is the doctoral student of the person before him. (No females here!)
