In the past couple of days, the authors of several blogs have noted that the wonderful book [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman (2nd ed., 2009) is now available for **[free download in pdf format](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/download.html)**.

Of course, it is also nice to have a hard copy. Click the image to purchase from Amazon.
