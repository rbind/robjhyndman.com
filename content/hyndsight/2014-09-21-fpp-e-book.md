My forecasting textbook with George Athanasopoulos is already available [online](http://www.otexts.org/fpp) (for free), and [in print via Amazon](http://amzn.com/0987507109/?tag=otexts-20) (for under $40). Now we have made it available as a downloadable e-book via [Google Books](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gDuRBAAAQBAJ) (for $15.55). The Google Books version is identical to the print version on Amazon (apart from a few typos that have been fixed).

To use the e-book version on an iPad or Android tablet, you need to have the Google Books app installed [[iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/google-play-books/id400989007?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.books&hl=en)]. You could also put it on an iPhone or Android phone, but I wouldn't recommend it as the text will be too small to read.

You can download a free sample (up to the end of Chapter 2) if you want to check how it will look on your device.

The sales of the print and e-book versions are used to fund the running the OTexts website where all OTexts books are freely available.

The online version is continuously updated --- any errors discovered are fixed immediately. The print and e-book versions will be updated approximately annually to bring them into line with the online version.
