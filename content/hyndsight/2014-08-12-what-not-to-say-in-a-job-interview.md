I've interviewed a few people for jobs at Monash University, and there's always someone who comes out with something surprising. Here are some real examples.<!-- more -->

For a post-doctoral research position:




    
  * Q: What would you say were your major weaknesses?

    
  * A: _I don't have any._

    
  * Q: Really? You can't think of anything that you could work on, new skills you could develop, anything at all that you might be able to improve?

    
  * A: _No, I don't think so._



From the same interview:


    
  * Q: Where do you see yourself in the next five years?

    
  * A: *I think I'll win a [Clay prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems).*



For a statistical consultant position:


    
  * Q: Suppose you have a client who is measuring some characteristic of people. She wants to know if there are any real differences between the measurements from people in Group A and those from people in Group B. What sort of data analysis or statistical models or tests would you use?

    
  * A: _I know what you want me to say, but what I'd actually do is persuade them to use the method in my latest paper published in xxxx._



For a post-doctoral research position on a project using Bayesian analysis:


    
  * Q: Suppose you try out these Bayesian ideas and it is not working out the way you expect. Then your supervisor suggests you try a non-Bayesian method that might work. What would you do?

    
  * A: _I wouldn't do it._

    
  * Q: But if your supervisor asked you to do it, using a method you have no experience with, what would you do?

    
  * A: _I would just say no._



I didn't make any of this up. I appreciate the honesty of these people, but if you are in a job interview, please think about what the employer might be looking for.
