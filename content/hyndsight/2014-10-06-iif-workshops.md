The International Institute of Forecasters [sponsors workshops](http://forecasters.org/conferences/iif-sponsored-workshops/) every year, each of which focuses on a specific theme. The purpose of these workshops is to facilitate small, informal meetings where experts in a particular field of forecasting can discuss forecasting problems, research, and solutions. Over the years, our workshops have covered topics from _Predicting Rare Events_, _ICT Forecasting_, and, most recently, _Singular Spectrum Analysis_. Often these workshops are associated with a special issue of the _International Journal of Forecasting_.

If you are already hosting a workshop on a forecasting topic and need support from the IIF, or if you are interested in organising and hosting a new workshop, please contact [George Athanasopoulos](mailto:george.athanasopoulos@monash.edu).

A list of past workshops and workshop guidelines are provided on the [IIF website](http://forecasters.org/conferences/iif-sponsored-workshops/).
