For many years I used [RWinEdt](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RWinEdt/) as my text editor for R code, but when [WinEdt 6.0](http://winedt.com/) came out, RWinEdt stopped working. So I've been looking for something to replace it. I've tried [Tinn-R](http://nbcgib.uesc.br/lec/software/editores/tinn-r/en), [NppToR](http://sourceforge.net/projects/npptor/), [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) with [StatET](http://www.walware.de/goto/statet) and a couple of other editors, but nothing was quite right.

Then yesterday, out of the blue, [RStudio](http://rstudio.org) was announced and it looks fantastic!  A screenshot is given below.

The window contains a smart editor with code completion and tabbing, console, workspace with viewable objects, plotting panel with history, etc. And it runs on all major platforms (or over the web if you have a linux server handy).

It is freeware. Download and installation was a breeze. I think this is my new working environment for R!
