Check out the two posts by Galit Shmueli over at [Bzst](http://www.bzst.com/) on hypothesis tests: one on the [value of p-values](http://www.bzst.com/2009/11/value-of-p-values-science-magazine-asks.html) and another on [one-sided tests](http://www.bzst.com/2009/10/testing-directional-hypotheses-p-values.html).

She says "Shockingly enough, people seem to really want to use p-values, even if they don't understand them." That mirrors my experience too.  Confidence intervals are much more useful because they provide a measure of the size of an effect, rather than testing if it is equal to some prespecified value.
