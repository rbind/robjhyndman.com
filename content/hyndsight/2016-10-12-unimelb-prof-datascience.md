The University of Melbourne is [advertising for a "Professor in Statistics (Data Science)"](http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/888074/professor-in-statistics-data-science). Melbourne (the city) is fast becoming a vibrant centre for data science and applied statistics, with more than 4700 people signed up for the [Data Science Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Melbourne/), a thriving start-up scene, the group at Monash Business School (including Di Cook and me), and the Monash Centre for Data Science (including Geoff Webb and Wray Buntine). Not to mention that Melbourne is a wonderful place to live, having won the "World's most liveable city" award from the Economist for the last 6 years in a row.

Actually, the Uni of Melbourne currently has two professorships on offer -- the other being the [Peter Hall Chair in Mathematical Statistics](http://jobs.unimelb.edu.au/caw/en/job/888076/peter-hall-chair-in-mathematical-statistics). (Not sure that anyone would actually feel qualified to have a job with that title!)

So any professors of statistics out there looking for a new challenge, please consider coming to Melbourne. We'll even invite you to visit us from time to time at Monash.
