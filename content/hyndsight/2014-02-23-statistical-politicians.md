Last week we had the pleasure of [Professor Stephen Pollock](http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/economics/people/professor-stephen-pollock) (University of Leicester) visiting our Department, best known in academic circles for his work on time series filtering (see [his papers](http://www.le.ac.uk/users/dsgp1/), and his [excellent book](http://amzn.com/0125609906/?tag=prorobjhyn-20)). But he has another career as a member of the UK House of Lords (under the name [Viscount Hanworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pollock,_3rd_Viscount_Hanworth) -- he is a hereditary peer).

It made me wonder how many other politicians have PhDs (or equivalent) in statistics, or at least in mathematics. I realise that a lot of mathematicians before the 20th century were often involved in politics, in one way or another, especially in France. Also, the notion of a PhD is a relatively recent invention. But if we restrict the time to 1950 onwards, there must be quite a few politicians with doctorates in the mathematical sciences. <!-- more -->

I could not locate any other statistical politicians, but a quick web search surfaced the following mathematicians:



	
  * [Alexander Lubotzky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lubotzky), PhD in mathematics, Bar-Ilan University. Member of the Israeli Knesset, 1996-1999.
	
  * [Ahmed Chalabi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Chalabi), PhD in mathematics from the University of Chicago. Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, 2005-2006.
	
  * [Faustin-Archange Touadéra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faustin-Archange_Touad%C3%A9ra), Mathematics doctorat, Lille University of Science and Technology, France, & University of Yaoundé I, Cameroon. Prime Minister of the Central African Republic, 2008-2013.
	
  * [Sergio Fajardo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Fajardo), PhD in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Governor of Antioquia, 2012-present.
	
  * [Daniel Biss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Biss), PhD in mathematics from MIT. Member of the Illinois Senate since 2013.
I'm sure there are many more, especially before 1996. Please add to the list in the comments.
