We consider bandwidth selection for the kernel estimator of conditional density with one explanatory variable. Several bandwidth selection methods are derived ranging from fast rules-of-thumb which assume the underlying densities are known to relatively slow procedures which use the bootstrap. The methods are compared and a practical bandwidth selection strategy which combines the methods is proposed. The methods are compared using two simulation studies and a real data set.

**Keywords:** density estimation; kernel smoothing; conditioning; bandwidth selection.
