## Functional data and demography packages

* [**addb**](https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/addb/):  Nine data sets, taken from the Australian Demographic Data Bank version 3.2b, courtesy of [Len Smith](mailto:leonard.smith@anu.edu.au).

* [**demography**](https://github.com/robjhyndman/demography): Provides a large number of functions for handling demographic statistics, modelling and forecasting. In particular, it implements lifetable calculations; Lee-Carter modelling and variants; functional data analysis of mortality rates, fertility rates, net migration numbers; and stochastic population forecasting. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=demography)]

* [**fds**](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=fds): Functional data sets useful for testing new methods. [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=fds)]

* [**smoothAPC**](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=smoothAPC): Smoothing demographic data with period and cohort effects. The method uses bivariate thin plate splines, bivariate lasso-type regularization, and allows for both period and cohort effects. Thus the mortality rates are modelled as the sum of four components: a smooth bivariate function of age and time, smooth one-dimensional cohort effects, smooth one-dimensional period effects and random errors. The methods are described in [Dokumentov & Hyndman (2014) Bivariate data with ridges: two-dimensional smoothing of mortality rates](https://robjhyndman.com/publications/mortality-smoothing/). [[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/package=smoothAPC)]
