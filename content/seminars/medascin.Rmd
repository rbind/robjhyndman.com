## Lab sessions

<a name="Lab1"></a>

### Lab Session 1

1. Download the [`Retail.Rmd`](/medascin/Retail.Rmd) file. This will be used for all analysis of the retail data.

2. Download the [monthly Australian retail data](https://robjhyndman.com/data/retail.xlsx). These represent retail sales in various categories for different Australian states.

3.  Read the data into R and choose *one* of the series. This time series will be used throughout the workshop in lab sessions 1--2, and 5--10.

    Please script this, don't just use the Rstudio click-and-point interface. That way you can save the results for easy replication later.

    You will need the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` package:

    ```r
    retaildata <- readxl::read_excel("retail.xlsx", skip = 1)
    mytimeseries <- ts(retaildata[["A3349873A"]], frequency=12, start=c(1982,4))
    autoplot(mytimeseries)
    ```

    [Replace the column name with your own chosen column.]

<a name="Lab2"></a>

### Lab Session 2

The following graphics functions have been introduced:

```r
autoplot, ggseasonplot, ggmonthplot, gglagplot, ggAcf, ggtsdisplay
```

  1. Explore your chosen retail time series using these functions.
  2. Can you spot any seasonality, cyclicity and trend?
  3. What do you learn about the series?

<a name="Lab3"></a>

### Lab Session 3

Download [the `Rmd` file](http://earo.me/lab/medascin17/lab3.Rmd) for this lab session.

1. Download the [billboard data](http://earo.me/data/medascin17/billboard.csv). The `billboard` dataset contains the date a song first entered the Billboard Top 100 in 2000 and its rank over 76 weeks.
2. Read the dataset into R and take a look at the data.
3. Transform the data to the long data form named as `billboard_long`.
4. [Bonus] Split the `billboard_long` to two separate datasets as `song` and `rank`. The `song` data will include `artist`, `track`, `time` and a new column called `id` assigning a unique identifier for each song. The `rank` data will include the `id`, `date`, `week`, `rank` columns. The `id` column is the key variable that maintains the linking between two datasets.

### Lab Session 4

Download [the `Rmd` file](http://earo.me/lab/medascin17/lab4.Rmd) for this lab session.

1. Download the [weather data](http://earo.me/data/medascin17/weather_2016.csv).
2. Read the dataset into R and tidy it up for visualising with `ggplot2` later.
3. Write some `ggplot2` code to reproduce the plot shown on the slides.

### Lab Session 5

  1. Use `ets()` to find the best ETS model for your retail data.

    - What does the model choice tell you about the data?
    - What do the smoothing parameters tell you about the trend and seasonality?
    - Do the forecasts look reasonable?

  2. Obtain up-to-date retail data from the [ABS website (Cat. 8501.0, Table 11)](https://goo.gl/HdrV0G), and compare your forecasts with the actual numbers. How good were the forecasts from the various models?

<a name="Lab6"></a>

### Lab Session 6

We will now fit an ARIMA model for your retail data.

  1. What Box-Cox transformation would you select to stabilize the variance?

  2. Use `auto.arima` to obtain a seasonal ARIMA model, and compare the forecasts with those you obtained earlier, and with the latest retail data.

  3. Experiment with different Box-Cox transformations to see their effect on the chosen model and forecasts.


<a name="Lab7"></a>


### Lab Session 7

For your retail time series:

  1. Use the `accuracy` function to compare the forecasts obtained from your ETS and ARIMA models. Which is giving the best forecasts?

  2. Repeat with forecasts obtained using `stlf` (with the same Box-Cox transformation as you used for the ARIMA model).

  3. Repeat with forecasts obtained using `snaive` (there's no need for a transformation).

  4. Which approach gives the best forecasts?


<a name="Lab8"></a>

### Lab Session 8

  1. Use `ets` to find the best model for your retail data and record the training set MAPE.
  1. We will now check how much larger the MAPE is on out-of-sample data using time series cross-validation. The following code will compute the result. Replace `???` with the appropriate values for your ETS model.

    ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
    fets <- function(x, h, model="ZZZ", damped=NULL, ...) {
      forecast(ets(x, model=model, damped=damped), h=h)
    }
    e <- tsCV(mytimeseries, fets, model=???, damped=???)
    pe <- 100*e/mytimeseries
    sqrt(mean(pe^2, na.rm=TRUE))
    ```

  1. Plot `pe` using `autoplot` and ``ggAcf``. Do they look uncorrelated and homoskedastic?

  1. In practice, we will not know the best model on the whole data set  until we observe all the data. So a more realistic analysis would be to allow `ets` to select a different model each time through the loop. Calculate the MAPE using this approach.  (Warning: there a lot of models to fit, so this will take a while.)

  1. How do the MAPE values compare? Does the re-selection of a model at each step make much difference?
